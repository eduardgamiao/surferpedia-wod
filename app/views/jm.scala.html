        <h3>Jake Marshall</h3>
        <p>What sets Jake apart from the current crop of young talent is his drive to excel in his surfing, and whatever else he takes aim at. He's fiercely competitive, winning the Under-12 division at the Surfing America Championships at Trestles last summer as the youngest member of the USA team. But his focus isn't limited to competitive surfing. Jake is a straight-A student, and takes better care of himself than most seasoned pros with a strict vegetarian diet and a daily yoga regimen. With such a solid base already established, he should have no trouble moving up through the ranks in the coming years.</p>
